# manga_text_bubble_detect_translate
This is a repository for a deep learning model that can detect text bubbles in manga and feed them into a translator.

You can see some example outputs in exds/v4_13600/

And if you want to translate your manga, you can clear the folder exds/v4_13600/ and put the manga you want to translate into the folder.
And then run python .\word_detect.py
